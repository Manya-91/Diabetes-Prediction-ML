# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

### 📘 Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic health measurements such as glucose level, BMI, age, and blood pressure.  
It demonstrates data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and performance evaluation — helping to understand how ML can support healthcare decisions.
